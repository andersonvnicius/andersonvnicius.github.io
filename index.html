        I'm a Last semester graduate student in automotive engineering, looking
        for oportunities to begin my carrer in the fields of software
        development and data science. You can email me on

      <h1>A little more about me</h1>
      <p>
        I consider myself to be very handful in solving problems and as a future
        engineer and I would like to develop tools to facilitate the lifes of
        many.

      <p>
        I am currently on the final stages of the development of a low cost open
        source dynamic torque sensor, which I want to futurely implement on
        competition teams for the competitions of Formula SAE and Baja SAE, or
        any other general application in which telemetry is important.
