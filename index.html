        I'm a Last semester graduate student in automotive engineering, looking
        for oportunities to begin my carrer in the fields of software
        development and data science.

      <h1>A little more about me</h1>
      <p>
        I consider myself to be very handful in solving problems and as a future
        engineer and I would like to develop tools to facilitate the lifes of
        many.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main skills at this time is coding in Python, programming arduino
        boards and analysing data related to physics and engineering problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like working with databases and SQL querries and still want to greatly
        develop these skills and other ones in the data engineering areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have studied the basics of machine learning model development packages
        Scikit-learn, Tensorflow and Spark Mllib and I still look forward to
        develop and apply this particular knowledge on the engineering field
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my hobbies i'm really into simulation racing games, and I want to
        develop a software for helping players analyse the performance of their
        cars using different set-ups and racing strategies. I play a lot of
        Assetto Corsa and have created a physical engine reving light using an
        arduino board and some leds.

      <p>
        I am currently on the final stages of the development of a low cost open
        source dynamic torque sensor, which I want to futurely implement on
        competition teams for the competitions of Formula SAE and Baja SAE, or
        any other general application in which telemetry is important.
