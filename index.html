        I'm a Last semester undergraduate student in automotive engineering, looking
        for opportunities to begin my career in the fields of software
        development and data science.

      <h1>A little more about me</h1>

      <p>
        I consider myself to be a very handful in solving problems and as a
        future engineer and I would like to develop tools to ease the lives of
        many.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main skills at this time are coding in Python, programming Arduino
        boards, and analyzing data related to physics and engineering problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in using databases and SQL queries and still want to
        greatly develop these skills and other ones in the data engineering
        areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have studied the basics of machine learning model development packages
        Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Spark Mllib and I still look forward to
        developing and apply this particular knowledge to engineering fields
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my hobbies, I'm really into simulation racing games, and I want
        to develop software for helping players analyze the performance of their
        cars using different set-ups and racing strategies. I play a lot of
        Assetto Corsa and have created a physical engine revving light using an
        Arduino board and some LEDs.

      <p>
        I am currently on the final stages of my college graduation thesys, in
        which I am developing a low-cost open source based dynamic torque
        sensoring device and I want to implement it on college competition
        vehicles such of the Formula SAE and Baja SAE cars, but the device will
        be usable on any other general application in which telemetry is
        important.
